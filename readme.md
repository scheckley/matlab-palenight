matlab-palenight
==============

Palenight colour theme applied to Matlab. Losely based on the excellent Vim theme here: https://github.com/drewtempelmeyer/palenight.vim

The Matlab editor's color theming doesn't seem to be as rich as vim or VS Code. I did what I could.

### Installation:
Append the contents to your matlab.prf configuration file and restart Matlab.

Location can be found using prefdir at the matlab command prompt.
